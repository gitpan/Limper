=head1 NAME

Limper::Engine - placeholder for the Limper::Engine namespace

=head1 VERSION

version 0.012

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Do not use this module directly. It currently does absolutely nothing, and likely never will.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This namespace is specifically for plugins that connect L<Limper> to a
particular web server or protocol (like L<Limper::Engine::PSGI>), using
hooks L<Limper/request_handler> and L<Limper/response_handler>.

See L<Limper::Extending> for how to write L<Limper> plugins.
