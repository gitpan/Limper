=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Limper::Passphrase> shows you how to deal with passphrases with L<Limper>,
and nothing more.  You might as well use L<M>, but this has documentation.

This also serves to show that you B<don't need to make everything a plugin
for Limper>.  If it's not messing with the request, response, or hooks, it
should not be a plugin.

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing additional is exported.
